### Bike Share Data Project
This repository contains my solution to the **Bikeshare Analysis** project from Udacity's 'Programming for Data Science with Python' Nanodegree program. The project contains an interactive python script that allows the user to gain insights into trends, patterns, and factors that influence bikeshare usage.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore bikeshare data and gain insights on the following:

- Most frequent times of travel (e.g., most common months, days of the week, and hours)
- The most popular stations and trip combinations
- Trip durations (total and average)
- User statistics (e.g., user types, gender, and birth year statistics)

The project uses data from bikeshare systems in Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following fields:

- **Start Time**: The timestamp when the trip started
- **End Time**: The timestamp when the trip ended
- **Trip Duration**: The duration of the trip in seconds
- **Start Station**: The station where the trip started
- **End Station**: The station where the trip ended
- **User Type**: The type of user (Subscriber or Customer)
- **Gender**: The gender of the user (Available for all cities except Washington)
- **Birth Year**: The birth year of the user (Available for all cities except Washington)

The data is available in CSV files for each city: `chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, and `washington.csv`.

## Requirements

To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:

- pandas
- numpy
- time

## Credits

- Special thanks to **Udacity** for providing the dataset and structure for this project.
- Thanks to the **Python** and **Pandas** communities for their open-source libraries that made this analysis possible.
