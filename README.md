# Bike Share Data Project

This repository contains my solution to the **Bikeshare Analysis** project from Udacity's 'Programming for Data Science with Python' Nanodegree program. The project contains an interactive python scripts that allows the user to gain insights into trends, patterns, and factors that influence bikeshare usage.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore bikeshare data and gain insights on the following:

- Most frequent times of travel (e.g., most common months, days of the week, and hours)
- The most popular stations and trip combinations
- Trip durations (total and average)
- User statistics (e.g., user types, gender, and birth year statistics)

The project uses data from bikeshare systems in Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
